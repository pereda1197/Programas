/*
 * SECTION 1: SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
 * ------------------------

 There are two kinds of packets, Data packets and Ack-only packets.
 There is a type field which differentiates. Ack packets are 8
 bytes, while Data packets vary from 10 to 510 bytes.

 Every Data packet contains a sequence number as well as 0 or
 more bytes of payload.

 Both Data and Ack packets contain the following fields.

 - cksum: 16-bit checksum. This checksum is automatically calculated
 for each packet transmitted. However, when the packet is received,
 you have to validate if the frame is corrupt with the VALIDATE_CHECKSUM
 function.

 - len: 16-bit total length of the packet.  This will be 8 for Ack
 packets, and 10 + payload-size for data packets (since 10
 bytes are used for the header of data packets).

 - ackno: acknowledgement index. The meaning of this index is up to the
 programmer. Essentially, there are two different options:
 	 · Confirms the reception of the frame with index "ackno".
 	 · Comfirms the reception of the frames previous to "ackno".
 	   and that the system is waiting for the frame "ackno".
 Note that data packets do not need to use this value.

 The following fields only exist in a data packet:

 - seqno: Each packet transmitted in a stream of data must be numbered
 with a sequence number, "seqno". The first packet in a stream has
 seqno 1.

 - data:  Contains (len - 10) bytes of payload data for the
 application.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------


 Important notes about the system:

 * The program, once completed, models a link with flow-control between to
 endpoints (different PCs). Real messages are sent between these PCs over the
 network. These messages are sent over UDP, IP (and Ethernet); however, this is
 not visible to the programmer.

 * There are two modes of operation. The default mode employs the console for input
 and output of data: when you write something on an endpoint, this string is sent to
 the other endpoint and printed on the console. Alternatively, the runtime can model
 synthetic traffic; you have to use the flag -s to activate this mode. In this model,
 packets of fixed size are generated as fast as possible.

 * You can pass some variables to the program, which are passed to the
 "connection_initialization" function:
 - window:  Tells you the size of the sliding window (which will
 be 1 for stop-and-wait). You can ignore the case of window > 1 (sliding window).
 - timeout: Tells you what your retransmission timer should be, in nanoseconds.
 If after these many nanoseconds a packet you sent has still not been acknowledged,
 you should retransmit the packet. You can use the function SET_TIMER to activate
 a timer. The default timer is 10 ms (10000000 ns).

 * Your task is to implement the following functions:

 "connection_initialization", "recv_callback", "send_callback", "timer_callback"

 as well to describe the connection state data.  All the
 changes you need to make are in the file eventCallbacks.c.
 YOU DO NOT HAVE TO CHANGE ANYTHING IN LIBRARY.C, LIBRARY.H or GLOBAL.H

 * Additionally, there are several API functions that are used to interact
 with the system, such as send or receive packets. The name of these functions
 employs CAPITAL LETTERS. The prototypes of these functions are in this file
 global.h. You do not need to understand the implementation in library.[ch]

 * When a packet is received, the library will call "recv_callback".
To accept the data you have received in a frame, call ACCEPT_DATA.

 * When the application has data to be sent, the library will call
 "send_callback". To get the input data that you must send in your packets,
 use READ_DATA_FROM_APP_LAYER. To transmit a packet, call SEND_ACK_PACKET
 or SEND_DATA_PACKET.

 * When the window closes (you cannot send more frames because you are
 waiting for ACK's) you have to notify the runtime using PAUSE_TRANSMISSION.
 This will pause the data generation, so "send_callback" will not be called.
 When the transmission window opens (when you receive the expected ACK's)
 you have to call RESUME_TRANSMISSION.

 * The program can model frame errors; you can specify the frame corruption
 probability using the -e flag. By default, there is no error corruption (although
 the real-world network that transmits the packets might loss some traffic).
 The frames have a checksum field in the header, which is automatically
 calculated and set by the library. However, you have to manually verify it
 using VALIDATE_CHECKSUM.

 * When a corruption occurs and a data packet does not receive the corresponding
 ACK, it has to be retransmitted. You should have activated a timer for this. There
 are up to 16 different timers (0 to 15) which can be active concurrently.
 Timers are set with SET_TIMER and cleared with CLEAR_TIMER. When a timer expires,
 "timer_callback" is called. The timeout of the timers is defined in nanoseconds;
 you have to compile with -lrt for this to work (this is included in the Makefile).

 * After transmission starts, the application displays statistics every 10 seconds.
 Note that these stats can consider either the "sent bytes" (including data and headers,
 and possibly from a duplicated frame), or "application bytes" (only the accepted data
 fields, without any duplication). Note that the transmission speed (in the sender side)
 and the average speed in the application level (in the receiver side) can differ
 significantly, especially when there are errors.

 * To aid debugging, you can use the -d flag, specifying a verbosity level.
 There are 3 verbosity levels, 1 to 3. When debugging is active, some messages
 are printed regarding the transmission and reception of packets, accepted data in
 the application layer, and errors. Each of these messages is displayed in a
 different colour. You can also print messages from your functions to help
 debugging (use "printf" for that)
